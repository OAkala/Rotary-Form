# Style Guidelines
Please adhere to all style guidelines as failure to do so will result in denied pull requests.

1.  If a new feature or enhancement requires a new class or tester, use the following format at the beginning of the file. Dotted lines should be all the way to hard-wrap limit.

```
/*
   *************************************************************************************************
   Program: "INSERT CLASS NAME".java
   Repository Name: Reboot
   Date Created: "INSERT DATE CREATED"
   Program Description: "INSERT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION"
   *************************************************************************************************
*/
```

2.  Use a preferred line length of 80 and hard-wrap of 100.

3.  Try to keep methods to a maximum of 30 lines.

4.  Put spaces around all operator symbols. That includes arithmetic operators and colons.

```
for (RotaryFormRecord record : table) {
```

5.  Add space after any comma.

6.  USE GENERAL GOOD CODING PRACTICES. Reference the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
